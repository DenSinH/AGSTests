### AGS tests

This repository is meant to (semi-)disassemble the AGS Aging Cartridge ROM for the GameBoy Advance. There has been
an effort to disassemble this ROM before, by Normmatt, found [here](https://github.com/Normmatt/ags_aging).

I use some of the information (mainly the test entry points) that he found. I hope he is okay with this. This project
is mainly aimed to be a source of information for emulator developers/GBA enthousiasts. 

Especially [this file](https://github.com/Normmatt/ags_aging/blob/0aa5aceebc79a26acfd974dd06451bb11f191de0/src/sub_8000AD4.c#L191) 
is of good use.
